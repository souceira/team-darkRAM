# DENNY!

## <i>Hi there!</i> ðŸŽ‰

My name is Denise Maranga, but I prefer to go by Denny. (<b>They/them</b> pronouns please!)

I'm a first year PhD Ecology and Evolutionary Biology student working on dinosaurs at the University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum! ðŸŽ‡ I love looking at their teeth and seeing how they differ as well as how they evolved.

## <i>Two truths and a lie:</i>

>ðŸ’¡ My favourite colour is pink.<br>
>ðŸ’¡ Nintendo sent me a cease-and-desist letter because I was selling Animal Crossing flowers on eBay.<br>
>ðŸ’¡ I have a pet bird that never stays in its cage while I'm home.

## <i>Socials? Anything else?</i>

I deleted all my socials so I have nothing to offer you, but I do draw in my free time! Here is a bonus artwork for reading through all of this.

I'm really enjoying SheHacks+ 7 so far! Thank you for the opportunity :-)
