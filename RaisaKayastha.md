## **Who am I? 🌸**<br>
Hi! My name is Raisa Kayastha. I’m a first year Computer Science student at Western University. My skills currently include Python, HTML, and I’ve just started learning Java as well.<br>


## **Experience at SheHacks+7 so far! 🏝️**<br>
SheHacks+7 is my first hackathon ever and I’m really enjoying it so far. I’m still exploring my options within computer science, but game development is something that’s caught my eye recently. To keep my options open, I’ve been trying to learn about machine learning and AI as well. One of my favourite things about SheHacks is how it provides opportunities for someone like me, who’s so new to the world of tech, to get a glimpse of everything whether it be through workshops or by connecting with sponsors. I’ll take this moment to thank you for your contribution to the event! It really does make a difference. I’ve always been a little scared to explore events like these since I know so little about programming and especially being a woman in the field, it has felt a bit daunting, but this experience has just been so comfy and cozy, so thank you! :)<3<br>
